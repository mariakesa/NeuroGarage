    """
    Selects a random time window from the LFP data and bins the spike times within that window for each unit.

    Parameters:
    - lfp (array-like): The LFP signal array with a 'time' attribute.
    - spike_times (list of numpy.ndarray): List containing spike time arrays for each unit.
    - window_duration (float): Duration of the time window in seconds (default: 0.25).
    - bin_size (float): Size of each bin in seconds for spike counting (default: 0.01).
    - sampling_rate (int): Sampling rate of the LFP in Hz (default: 1252).

    Returns:
    - lfp_in_window (numpy.ndarray): LFP data within the selected time window.
    - binned_spikes (numpy.ndarray): 2D array of spike counts per unit per bin within the window.
